# parrot.live

An initiative, using frames from [`terminal-parrot`](https://github.com/jmhobbs/terminal-parrot), to allow any computer with `curl` to display an _animated_ party parrot.

# Try it!
```bash
curl parrot.live
```

# :partyparrot:
<div align="center">
  <img src='https://d.pr/i/jKluc0.gif' />
</div>
